    Week1 Objective is to begin the creation of my Ruzga Solutions Group LLC website to eventhually be used as my LLC website

    Steps included in this assignment which you will find below are:
        -create a homepage named index.html (home page, this is the About Us page)
        -At least 3 pages with links to navigate between all pages present on each page. This will be "Home", "About", and "Contact Us"
        - 2 different size headers, a list, 3 images, a table, and a form

    You will also find good developer documentation throughout this code

    Finally you will find a walk thru video for this assignment posted in my YouTube and accessible via an unlisted link

    Please note on this page I have used an image, H1 & H2 header sizes and carried the footer along
